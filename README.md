# Tic Tac Toe Web by Hrant
This is the client repository, the server repository is still not ready for full publishment (Hoping it can be soon)
https://tictactoehrant.herokuapp.com

# Main Goal
This is my Project to make a completely functional and quick Tic Tac Toe Game on the Web Hosted on heroku, maintained by me.
My aim is to make it really simple and fast without any sign-in or extra steps to start playing, hope this is what gets to the users.

You can start by either creating a game or joining a game with the code.
# How to creating a game
- Press on the create game button
- On the bottom of the screen you should see a code (Consisting of Uppercase letters and numbers)
- Share that code with a friend.

# How to joining a game
- Paste the code in the text box and press join game
- You should be in the game with your friend

By default, the person who created the game is player one, and even after play again, they are still player #1 (X).

# Contributing
For the time being i will not implement any contributing guidelines, i will try to fix issues by myself and see how that goes

# License
As with contributing, again i will not enforce any license for the time being as i dont see it as a necessity

# Feedback
I hope to see feedback on what can be changed to make the game a bit smoother and bug free.
For any other suggestions or help you can contact me

Thank you!
