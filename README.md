# Tic Tac Toe Web by Hrant

https://tictactoehrant.herokuapp.com

My Project to make a completely functional and quick Tic Tac Toe Game on the Web.
Hosted on heroku, maintained by me.

My main aim is to make it really simple and fast without any sign or extra steps to start playing, hope this is what gets to the users.

You can start by either creating a game or joining a game with the code.

# Creating a game:
- Press on the create game button
- On the bottom of the screen you should see a code (Consisting of Uppercase letters and numbers)
- Share that code with a friend.

# Joining a game:
- Paste the code in the text box and press join game
- You should be in the game with your friend

By default, the person who created the game is player one, and even after play again, they are still player #1 (X).

# Contributing:
For the time being i will not implement any contributing guidelines, i will try to fix issues by myself and see how that goes

# License
As with contributing, again i will not enforce any license for the time being as i dont see it as a necessity

# Feedback
I hope to see feedback on what can be changed to make the game a bit smoother and bug free.

Thank you!
